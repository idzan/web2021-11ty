# Marko Idzan Web Refresh for 2021

This will be my refreshed web site built using:

* HTML and modern code practices
* SCSS/SASS to be more organized
* JavaScript for some basics and Dark/Light Mode Conversion
* 11ty as SSG
* SVG for icons
* AVIF and WEBP images with fallback to JPG when needed

Most of design is already completed on another repo but this will be more organized as 11ty will help to code be more easier to read and easier to implement.
